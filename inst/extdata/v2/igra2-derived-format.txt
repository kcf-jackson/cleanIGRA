Format of the IGRA-Derived Sounding Parameters Files

---------------------
Notes:
---------------------

1. Sounding-derived parameters are available for a subset of the soundings 
   in IGRA. This subset includes soundings at fixed observing stations on 
   land that contain temperature observations and a surface pressure level.
   The parameters include precipitable water between the surface and 500 hPa,
   the refractive index, vertical gradients of several variables, and 
   various measures of boundary-layer characteristics and stability.

2. The derived parameters are updated once a day in the early morning Eastern
   Time.

3. Each "-drvd.txt.zip" file contains the sounding-derived parameters for one 
   station. The name of the file corresponds to a station's IGRA 2 identifier
   (e.g., "USM00072201-drvd.txt.zip"  contains the derived parameters for the 
   station with the identifier USM00072201).

4. Each file contains a series of multiline sounding records, each of which 
   consists of a header record followed by one line of data for each pressure 
   level in the sounding. Non-pressure levels are not included.

5. All missing parameter values are coded as -99999.
