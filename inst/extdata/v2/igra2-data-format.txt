Format Description of IGRA 2 Sounding Data Files

---------------------
Notes:
---------------------

2. Both types of files are updated once a day in the early morning Eastern
   Time. The latest observations usually become available within two 
   calendar days of when they were taken.

2. Data files are available for two different time spans:

   In subdirectory data-por, data files contain the full period of record.
   In subdirectory data-y2d, files only contain soundings from the current
     (or current and previous) year. For example, as of August 2016, 
     the files in the data-y2d subdirectory begin with January 1, 2016.

3. Each file in the data-por and data-y2d subdirectories contains the 
   sounding data for one station.
   The name of the file corresponds to a station's IGRA 2 identifier (e.g.,
   "USM00072201-data.txt.zip"  contains the data for the station with the 
   identifier USM00072201).

3. Each sounding consists of one header record and n data 
   records, where n (given in the header record) is the number of levels
   in the sounding.

These variables have the following definitions:

HEADREC		is the header record indicator (always set to "#").

ID		is the station identification code. See "igra2-stations.txt"
		for a complete list of stations and their names and locations.

YEAR 		is the year of the sounding.

MONTH 		is the month of the sounding.

DAY 		is the day of the sounding.

HOUR 		is the nominal or observation hour of the sounding (in UTC on
		the date indicated in the YEAR/MONTH/DAY fields). Possible 
		valid hours are 00 through 23, and 99 = missing. Hours are 
		given as provided by the data provider, and the relationship 
		between this hour and the release time varies by data 
		provider, over time, and among stations.

RELTIME 	is the release time of the sounding in UTC. The format is
		HHMM, where HH is the hour and MM is the minute. Possible
		are 0000 through 2359, 0099 through 2399 when only the release
		hour is available, and 9999 when both hour and minute are 
		missing.

NUMLEV 		is the number of levels in the sounding (i.e., the number of 
		data records that follow).

P_SRC 		is the data source code for pressure levels in the sounding.

		level of climatology-based quality assurance checks were 
		applied. It has three possible values:
