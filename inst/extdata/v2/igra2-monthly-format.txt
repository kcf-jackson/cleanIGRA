Format Description of IGRA 2 Monthly-Mean Files

---------------------------------
Notes:
---------------------------------

1. Monthly means are computed for the surface and mandatory levels at the 
   nominal times of 00 and 12 UTC, considering data within two hours of each 
   nominal time. They are therefore available for a subset of the stations 
   and months in IGRA. This subset includes fixed observing stations on 
   land and year/months in which a sufficient number of surface or
   standard-pressure level observations are available within two hours 
   of 0000 UTC or 1200 UTC.

2. Once a month, usually on the sixth of the month, monthly means are
   recalculated and means for the previous month are made available. For example,
   monthly means for August 2014 became available on September 6, 2014.

3. Monthly-mean files are available for two different time spans:

   In subdirectory monthly-por, files contains monthly means the full period 
     of record of 0000 and 1200 UTC observations.
   In subdirectory monthly-upd, files only contain monthly means for the last
     available month.

4. File names are of the form VVVV_HHz-mly.txt in subdirectory monthly-por 
   and of the form VVVV_HHz-mly-YYYYMM.txt in subdirectory monthly-upd,
   where VVVV = variable, HH = nominal hour in UTC, and YYYYMM is the
   year/month of the last available month. 

   There are five possible values for VVVV: 

   ghgt = Geopotential height
   temp = Temperature
   uwnd = Zonal wind component
   vapr = Vapor pressure
   vwnd = Meridional wind component

   There are two possible values for HH: 

   00 = 0000 UTC
   12 = 1200 UTC

5. Each record in a file contains the monthly mean for one
   station/year/month/level. A mean is provided only if it can be calculated
   from at least 10 observations.

Variable   Columns  Type
---------------------------------
ID            1- 11  Character
YEAR         13- 16  Integer
MONTH        18- 19  Integer
LEVEL        21- 24  Integer
VALUE        26- 31  Integer
NUM          33- 34  Integer
---------------------------------

These variables have the following definitions:

ID		is the station identification code. See "igra2-stations.txt"
		for a complete list of stations and their names and locations.

YEAR 		is the year of the record.

MONTH 		is the month of the record.

LEVEL 		is the pressure level. It has 22 possible values:

		9999 = surface level
		1000 = 1000 hPa
		 925 = 925 hPa
		 850 = 850 hPa
		 700 = 700 hPa
		 500 = 500 hPa
		 400 = 400 hPa
		 300 = 300 hPa
		 250 = 250 hPa
		 200 = 200 hPa
		 150 = 150 hPa
		 100 = 100 hPa
		  70 = 70 hPa
		  50 = 50 hPa
		  30 = 30 hPa
		  20 = 20 hPa
		  10 = 10 hPa
		   7 = 7 hPa
		   5 = 5 hPa
		   3 = 3 hPa
		   2 = 2 hPa
		   1 = 1 hPa

VALUE 		is the monthly mean. Units are as follows:

		Geopotential height (ghgt): whole meters 
		Temperature (temp): degrees Celsius to tenths (e.g., 
		  11 = 1.1°C)
		Vapor pressure (vapr): Pascal
		Zonal wind (uwnd): meters per second to tenths (e.g.,
		  11 = 1.1 m/s)
		Meridional wind (vwnd): meters per second to tenths (e.g.,
		  11 = 1.1 m/s)

NUM 	is the number of values used to calculate the mean.
